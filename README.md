## What?
Arsenite Token Login is a plugin that makes it hilariously easy to log into Discord accounts with tokens.
When the plugin is active, going to https://discord.com?token=yourtokenhere will make the plugin log you in.

This plugin is used for [Arsenite's](https://arsenite.io) 'Log in' function.

## Installation
Installation is as easy as installing any other plugin on Firefox. You can find the link to do so [here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/arsenite-token-login/).

To install it on Chromium based browsers, please do the following:
- Download the repo and zip the 'src' directory.
- Go to chrome://extensions in your browser and turn on developer mode.
- Press 'Load unpacked' and select the zipped 'src' directory.

It should be noted that the way this plugin sets tokens is not very reliable on chrome.
